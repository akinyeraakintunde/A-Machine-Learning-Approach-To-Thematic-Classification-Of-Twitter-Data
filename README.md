# A Machine Learning Approach to Thematic Classification of Twitter Data

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive project that leverages **machine learning techniques** to classify thematic content from Twitter data. The project is designed to automatically categorize tweets into meaningful topics, enabling insights into public opinion, trends, and thematic patterns.

The project demonstrates **end-to-end data science workflow**, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The repository is structured to facilitate reproducibility, scalability, and adaptation for similar social media analytics tasks.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to **classify tweets into thematic categories** using natural language processing (NLP) and supervised machine learning methods.
Key objectives include:

* Extracting and preprocessing raw Twitter data.
* Cleaning and normalizing text data (tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming/lemmatization).
* Feature engineering using TF-IDF, embeddings, and other vectorization techniques.
* Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models for classification.
* Providing visual insights through charts and reports.

This project demonstrates a robust approach to **text classification**, suitable for research, MSc/PhD projects, or industry applications in social media analytics.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of Twitter posts collected using the **Twitter API**. Each tweet is labeled with one or more thematic categories, such as:

* Politics
* Sports
* Technology
* Health
* Entertainment

Data preprocessing includes:

* Removing URLs, mentions, hashtags, and emojis
* Lowercasing and punctuation removal
* Tokenization and lemmatization

> Note: Due to Twitter API restrictions, the raw dataset is not included in this repository. Users must collect their own dataset or use a subset provided in `data/sample_tweets.csv`.

## Project Pipeline

The pipeline follows a **structured machine learning workflow**:

1. **Data Collection** – Retrieve tweets using Twitter API.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Text normalization, removing noise, tokenization.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding distribution of themes, word clouds, and tweet lengths.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Vectorization (TF-IDF, word embeddings).
5. **Modeling** – Train and evaluate models including:

   * Logistic Regression
   * Random Forest Classifier
   * Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
   * Deep Learning (optional)
6. **Evaluation & Visualization** – Accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, and thematic visualizations.
7. **Reporting** – Summary of findings and insights in structured reports (PDF/HTML).

## Modeling

The models implemented include:

* **Logistic Regression** – Baseline linear model.
* **Random Forest** – Handles feature interactions and non-linear relationships.
* **XGBoost** – Optimized gradient boosting model for high performance.
* **Optional Deep Learning Models** – LSTM or Transformer-based models for sequence classification.

Evaluation metrics used:

* Accuracy
* Precision, Recall, F1-score
* Confusion Matrix
* ROC-AUC (for binary or multi-class classification)
